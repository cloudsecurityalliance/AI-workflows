# Bing

Bing is generally best for finding and consuming data. It seems to have some limitations around input size (e..g currently 2000 characters, or roughly 500 tokens).

You'll need to install the Microsot Edge browser or ap lugin that fakes the User-Agent.

## Logging your Bing sessions

There is a plugin to log all sessions, rmemeber to change the defaults from just export to PNG to PNG and JSON.
